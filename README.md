# Projective Geometric Algebra for Unity

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blueviolet.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## What is this?

A library for doing Euclidean Plane-Based Geometric Algebra (basically, "Projective Geometric Algebra") in Unity, based on [the bivector.net library](https://bivector.net/tools.html). It includes operator overloading and conversion between Unity-style objects and PGA-style objects, i.e. Unity quaternions and vectors and PGA points, directions, rotors and motors.

## How can I learn Projective Geometric Algebra?

<!-- ## Example

//You want something here

## Usage

1. Copy the .cs file into your project folder alongside your other .cs files
2. Put the line `using static PGA3D;` at the top of any file you want to use PGA in, and you're good to go!

## Discord

I can recommend the [Bivector Discord](https://discord.gg/q3uRnzxG). You can ask any question, from the most basic to the most advanced, and there should be someone there to help you!

## TODOs. Let me know if you'd like me to get of my arse and implement these!

- There may be a problem with the minus signs of the join and projections. It is very unlikely to affect anyone. This is ongoing research in my opinion
- Conversion to Matrix4x4. This should be easy, I just don't have time.
- Dedicated Dual Quaternion, Bivector, point, plane classes. Add in flector and now we're more typed I guess?
- Perhaps you should even just be able to use unity planes as- is. Not vectors though, there's unavoidable ambiguity about directions vs positions in there
- Arbitrary distance and angle formulae
- Overload some operator to do sandwiching
- More compatibility with FABRIK
- I might be being paranoid to have (~X) rather than just ~X

## Credits

Aside from writing (the code that generated) the initial version of this library, I am heavily indebted to Steven De Keninck! Indebted too to others who helped me including Pontus Granstr√∂m, Chris Doran, Anthony John Bell, Charles Gunn, Hugo Hadfield, Eric Lengyel, Simon Fenney, and Martin Roelfs
