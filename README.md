# Projective Geometric Algebra for Unity

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blueviolet.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## What is this?

A library for doing Projective Geometric Algebra in Unity, based on [the bivector.net library](https://bivector.net/tools.html). It includes operator overloading and conversion between Unity-style objects and PGA-style objects, i.e. Unity quaternions and vectors and PGA points, directions, rotors and motors.

## How can I learn Projective Geometric Algebra?

<!-- ## Example
`
//You want something here
` -->

## Usage

1. Copy the .cs file into your project folder alongside your other .cs files
2. Put the line `using static PGA3D;` at the top of any file you want to use PGA in

## Future

I have a visualization for all of these things that I might put in here too.

## Discord

I do recommend the [Bivector Discord](https://discord.gg/q3uRnzxG). Sorry there are so many crackpots. Honestly it just seems to go with the territory that geometric algebra is both iconoclastic and very visual.

## Credits

Aside from writing (the code that generated) the initial version of this library, I am personally heavily indebted to Steven Der Keninck! Very indebted also to many other people in the GA community.
